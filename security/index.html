        <h1> Security Assessment for Caroline Ramani </h1>
        <div id="subheader"><p> Prepared by Dylan Phelan -- 12/2/2014 </p> </div>


        <h2> Introduction </h2>
        <p> 
            This security assessment aims to investigate any pitfalls found in 
            <a href='http://sleepy-oasis-4490.herokuapp.com'/>Caroline Ramani's web application.</a> 
            The aim of this application, according to the 
            <a href='http://tuftsdev.github.io/WebProgramming/assignments/a3.html'>project specifications laid out here</a>
            is to develop a sever-side web application that maintains user login 
            check-ins for a long period of time. While the application meets a large 
            portion of the specification requirements, there are several vulnerabilities 
            that would need to be addressed before usage in any public sense. 
        </p> 


        <h2> Methodology </h2>
        <p> 
            Most of the project's vulnerablities were found with a simple black box
            approach, testing a few common faults in web engineering. Once a 
            few solid problems were pinpointed, a glance over the source code
            pointed me towards a couple of other server-side faults that could
            leave the web-app open for attacks
        </p>


        <h2> Abstract of Findings </h2>
        <p>
                Five vulnerabilities were pinpointed, the majority of which
                stem from a strong faith in the client's external input. In overview,
                the weakpoints to be discussed can lead to server crash, cross-side
                scripting that affects later users, and access to the entire database
                by anyone -- all of which pose issues for public usage. 
        </p>
