        <h1> Security Assessment for Caroline Ramani </h1>
        <div id="subheader"><p> Prepared by Dylan Phelan -- 12/2/2014 </p> </div>


        <h2> Introduction </h2>
        <p> 
            This security assessment aims to investigate any pitfalls found in 
            <a href='http://sleepy-oasis-4490.herokuapp.com'/>Caroline Ramani's web application.</a> 
            The aim of this application, according to the 
            <a href='http://tuftsdev.github.io/WebProgramming/assignments/a3.html'>project specifications laid out here</a>
            is to develop a sever-side web application that maintains user login 
            check-ins for a long period of time. While the application meets a large 
            portion of the specification requirements, there are several vulnerabilities 
            that would need to be addressed before usage in any public sense. 
        </p> 


        <h2> Methodology </h2>
        <p> 
            Most of the project's vulnerablities were found with a simple black box
            approach, testing a few common faults in web engineering. Once a 
            few solid problems were pinpointed, a glance over the source code
            pointed me towards a couple of other server-side faults that could
            leave the web-app open for attacks
        </p>


        <h2> Abstract of Findings </h2>
        <p>
                Five vulnerabilities were pinpointed, the majority of which
                stem from a strong faith in the client's external input. In overview,
                the weakpoints to be discussed can lead to server crash, cross-side
                scripting that affects later users, and access to the entire database
                by anyone -- all of which pose issues for public usage. 
        </p>

        <h2> Issues Found </h2>
        <hr>

                <h3> Issue: Location Faking </h3>
                <ul>
                        <li> 
                            Affects the POST interface 
                        </li>
                        <li> 
                            Severity of Issue: LOW. The problem is not a huge issue
                            as of the current implementation, since there are no rewards 
                            to be reaped from the information sent, the data serving mostly 
                            as a static database. But the issue should be address in order 
                            to make the API both accurate and, consequently, more versatile.
                        </li>
                        <li> 
                            Description of Issue: As of current the implementation
                            there is no check in place to verify if the client's lat
                            and lng information. In the event that this API was to be 
                            used for use in any public sphere, the lack of cross reference
                            means the client can very easily forge any information sent to 
                            the server. This could cause problems if the API information is 
                            to be used in any system where there are incentives to be in 
                            certain locations -- people could easily forge the information 
                            and reap the rewards. 
                        </li>
                        <li> 
                            Proof of Vulnerability: Below are
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Resolution 
                        </li>
                </ul>

                <h3> Issue: Wild Card Access </h3>
                <ul>
                        <li> 
                            Affects the GET API 
                        </li>
                        <li> 
                            Severity of Issue: LOW. The issue is easily remedied and
                            and, in the worst case, simply alllows for free use of the 
                            API. This may be an issure in terms of tracking who is commiting 
                            what to the database and 
                        </li>
                        <li>

                <h3> Issue: Complete Access to Database </h3>
                <ul> 
                        <li>

                        <li>
                            Severity of Issue: LOW. As of now there is limited
                            information displayed, little of which is sensitive.
                            As a location loader, however, having access to all
                            logins -- not just the last 100 logins -- might raise
                            some flags regarding who has full access to whose
                            information.
