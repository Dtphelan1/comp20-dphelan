        <h2> Introduction </h2>
        <p> 
            This security assessment aims to investigate any pitfalls found in 
            <a href='http://sleepy-oasis-4490.herokuapp.com'/>Caroline Ramani's web application.</a> 
            The aim of this application, according to the 
            <a href='http://tuftsdev.github.io/WebProgramming/assignments/a3.html'>project specifications laid out here</a>
            is to develop a sever-side web application that maintains user login 
            check-ins for a long period of time. While the application meets a large 
            portion of the specification requirements, there are several vulnerabilities 
            that would need to be addressed before usage in any public sense.

        <p> 
            Most of the project's vulnerablities were found with a simple black box
            approach, testing a few common faults in web engineering. Once a
