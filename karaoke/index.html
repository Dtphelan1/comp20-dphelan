	<p>
		Oh, I could hide 'neath the wings
		Of the bluebird as she sings.
		The six o'clock alarm would never ring.
		But it rings and I rise,
		Wipe the sleep out of my eyes.
		My shavin' razor's cold and it stings.
	</p>	
	<p>
		Cheer up, Sleepy Jean.
		Oh, what can it mean.
		To a daydream believer
		And a homecoming queen.
	</p>
	<p>	
		You once thought of me
		As a white knight on a steed.
		Now you know how happy I can be.
		Oh, and our good times start and end
		Without dollar one to spend.
		But how much, baby, do we really need.
	</p>
	<p>
		Cheer up, Sleepy Jean.
		Oh, what can it mean.
		To a daydream believer
		And a homecoming queen.
		Cheer up, Sleepy Jean.
		Oh, what can it mean.
		To a daydream believer
		And a homecoming queen.
	</p>
	<p>	
		[Instrumental interlude]
	</p> 
	<p>
		Cheer up, Sleepy Jean.
		Oh, what can it mean.
		To a daydream believer
		And a homecoming queen.
		[Repeat and fade]
