README for Comp20-Dphelan Repo
===============================



### Purpose: 

        A private repository for all Web Programming assigments.


#### Assignments: 

        - A responsive design assignment, investigating how responsive design in
        CSS can be used to change design data under certain condition.

        - A website that presents lyrics on a screen in sync with words in
        a music video.

        - A website that tries to (read: fails to) parse JSON data from a
        website with a different origin.

        - A Marauder's Map inspired website that displays the locations of
        a variety of different students and characters.

        - A server-side implementation of a website that takes in locations
        of users, displays that information to users, allows users to query 
        for specific login information and displays redline.json information
        
        - A security write-up for Caroline Ramani's implementation of the above 
        assignment, highlighting pitfalls and possible solutions.


#### Favorite Assignmnet: 

        - The security write up, by far. I've been excited for months to get 
        a peak at the security side of web development. And now that I've 
        seen how accessible The Dark Arts are (The Defense side, of course), 
        I'm looking forward to learning more on my own.
        
#### Growth: 

        - Over the past semester I've learned a couple of important things 
        from this course: Never trust data from the client; no one should 
        waste their time reinventing the wheel; building useful applications
        is possible and exciting; and almost everything you want to see done
        can be done -- the resources are out there, available, even if they 
        are hard to find. Seeing as I didn't know a lot of things three months
        ago, I'd say I've grown a helluvah lot. 

#### Take Aways: 
        
        - Never having taken a CS course in high school, getting a late start 
        in the CS field the knowledge of all those around me has been intimidating, 
        terrifying. And this course drives that point home. Sitting in the lab 
        late at night, the evening an assignment is done, I see a lot of students
        around me flying through paragraphs of code, code that had taken me an hour 
        to get started on. It's not the most comfortable process, but the discomfort 
        makes it hard to forget; and  at the end of the day, I got it done. Not all 
        of it was perfect, every now and then I'd make stupid mistakes -- miss 
        a detail in the specs here, leave out an obvious check that I needed. 
        Everything is out there if I look hard enough, and I'll use that fact 
        the rest of my life.
        
        - We've learned a lot this semester, we've gotten a taste of so many 
        different fields and technologies. There's a lot out there, and it's 
        enticing to think that one woman or man can do it all, tackle the whole
        field with broad shoulders, take everything on all at once. And I can say
        with a fair amount of confidence: 
        That doesn't work.
        One cannot be a master of front-end development, back-end 
        infrastructure, security analysis, scripting, low level languages, 
        compiliers, functional programming, processor development and
        live a life even passingly enjoyable. And that's okay. Instead 
        of spreading myself too thin, I'm going to work on devoting myself 
        to one or two fields seriously, dabbling in other fields for fun more 
        than anything. 
        

#### Future Plans: 

        - As alluded to above, I'm very excited to dive into the security field
        in both the coming semesters and vacations. Expect to see me next fall, 
        Ming -- I'll see you in security.
