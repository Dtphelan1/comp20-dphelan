README for Comp20-Dphelan Repo
===============================



###Purpose: 

        A private repository for all Web Programming assigments.


####Assignments: 

        - A responsive design assignment, investigating how responsive design in
        CSS can be used to change design data under certain condition.

        - A website that presents lyrics on a screen in sync with words in
        a music video.

        - A website that tries to (read: fails to) parse JSON data from a
        website with a different origin.

        - A Marauder's Map inspired website that displays the locations of
        a variety of different students and characters.

        - A server-side implementation of a website that takes in locations
        of users, displays that information to users, allows users to query 
        for specific login information and displays redline.json information
        
        - A security write-up for Caroline Ramani's implementation of the above 
        assignment, highlighting pitfalls and possible solutions.


####Favorite Assignmnet: 

        - The security write up, by far. I've been excited for months to get 
        a peak at the security side of web development. And now that I've 
        seen how accessible The Defense of The Dark Arts is, I'm looking 
        forward to learning more on my own.
        
####Growth: 

        - Over the past semester I've learned a couple of important things 
        from this course: Never trust data from the client; no one should 
        waste their time reinventing the wheel; building useful applications
        is possible and exciting; and almost everything you want to see done
        can be done -- the resources are out there, available, even if they 
        are hard to find. But it can be done. 

####Take Aways: 
        
        - Everything is out there if I look hard enough. Never having taken 
        a CS course in high school, getting a late start in the CS field 
        the knowledge of all those around me has been intimidating, terrifying. 
        And this course drives that point home. Sitting in the lab late at night, 
        the evening an assignment is done, I see a lot of students around me 
        flying through paragraphs of code, code that had taken me an hour to
        get started on. But at the end of the day, I got it done. Not all 
        of it was perfect, every now and then I'd make stupid mistakes -- miss 
        a detail in the specs here, leave out an obvious check that I needed. 
        But at the end of the day -- I got it done. 
        
        - We've learned a lot this semester, we've gotten a taste of so many 
        different fields and technologies. There's a lot out there, and it's 
        enticing to think that 

####Future Plans: 

        - As alluded to above, I'm very excited to dive into the security field
        in both the coming semesters and vacations. Expect to see me next fall, 
        Ming -- I'll see you in security.
