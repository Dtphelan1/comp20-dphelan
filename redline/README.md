    ###Purpose:### 

        The purpose of this lab is to gain practice writing 
        JavaScript, using third party API's, parsing JSON 
        data and to understand the limitations of client-side 
        JavaScript.

    ###Time Spent:###
        
        Approximately 4 hours were spent on this project.

    ###Implementation:###

        The author firmly believes that all aspects of this 
        project were implemented to plausible specifications. 

    ###Questions:###
       
        One of the motivating questions behind this project 
        was what are the limits of client-side JS; specifically,
        is it possible to request the real-time data from the 
        MBTA using XMLHttpRequest? The author has concluded 
	that it is impossible to use only client-side javascript
	to parse real time information from a separate server; this
	is due to the JavaScript Same Origin policy, which makes it
	impossible for me to reference another individual's DOM if they
	have a different origin.
